Hades is an input emulator.

It maps your Gamepad controls to your keyboard/mouse. This means that you can use your Gamepads to play games that dont support them. Try playing Mario with an xBox controller. Its crazy fun.

The main screen shows two tabs, where you can manually map what keys to map to what controls.

The project was originally created on the Dev C++ IDE, and you can find the project files for the same. However, the source files can be used on any IDE that can compile C++.

The project compiles to an exe that is the main program. A rudimentary project page can be found here - http://hadesemulator.weebly.com/
You will also find the program installer on the page. Feel free to try it out.


You are free to do whatever you want with the project. If you would like to discuss something about the project or if you are simply feeling lonely, you can reach me at hades.devgupta@gmail.com
